# Colorized-Project

üü®üü•üü©üü¶

---

This is a fork of the [Project-Color by nowtilous of which the maintenance seems to be somewhat abandoned][original].

In general, some stale pull requests have been merged and some issues have been fixed.

The plugin has been renamed to Colorized-Project to namespace away and avoid confusion with the original plugin.

The plugin has been updated to work with the latest IntelliJ versions.

The README below is a WIP and may include references to the original plugin.

<!-- Plugin description -->
Remember your projects by color! Colorize the title bar to differentiate your open projects.

Working on multiple projects simultaneously with intellij products can be difficult,
since they all look the same on the taskbar, this plugin solves that by giving the user the option
to colorize each project's title bar, which is visible from the taskbar windows menu.
